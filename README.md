## Instructions

The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards. Try to find a pair of matching cards by clicking on two cards to open them. If the cards match they will remain open and then try to match another pair of cards. Continue matching cards till all 16 matching cards have been opened. When all 16 cards have been matched, a will see a messaging displaying your score, the number of moves you mage, and the time it took you to complete. You then have the option of clicking on the 'restart button' to play again.
